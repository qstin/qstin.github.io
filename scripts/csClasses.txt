        ASU's Cronkite School is great at churning out journalists 
        specialized in broadcast, sports and business. But students with 
        data-journalism aspirations are left to fend for themselves.

        At least that's how I felt after taking Steve Doig's Precision 
        Journalism class a few years ago. I knew I wanted to learn how to 
        program for data-heavy investigative projects, but felt I had no 
        resources beyond Doig's wisdom, vast as it is. So I ventured else-
        where to find the tools I needed. 

        Below is a list I've compiled of courses offered at ASU that can
        endow you with essential skills in computer-assisted reporting.

        1. JMC 465 - Precision Journalism
            - Covers introductory statistical methods frequently used
              by journalists and how to obtain data for stories.

        2. CSE 110 - Introductory Programming with Java
            - Provides foundational concepts of programming and computer
              science.
        
        3. GIS 341 - Introduction to Cartography and Geo-representation
            - Teaches design, statistical and geographical concepts 
              necessary for representing data spatially. 

        4. TWC 414 - Visualizing Information
            - Uses the R programming language to analyze data visually and 
              Adobe Illustrator for post-production. 

        5. CIS 494 - Unix Information Systems
            - Ignore the business school jargon used to describe this class
              on ASU's website. You'll learn to take control of the command 
              line by writing powerful commands, functions and scripts. Also,
              the professors is one of the coolest nerds you'll ever meet.
        
        6. GIS 470 - Statistics for Geographers
            - This class also uses R, but focuses less on visualization and 
              more on advanced statistical concepts. Take this to keep the stat 
              juices flowing.

        7. CSE 205 - Object-oriented Programming with Java
            - The advanced follow-up to CSE 110. This class really nails down
              important programming practices and principles. Java is difficult 
              and almost useless to journalists because of its complexity, but 
              knowing it makes learning other languages much simpler.

        8. AME 220 - Programming for the Web
            - While the concepts covered in this class are introductory, the 
              course structure and professor don't facilitate the best 
              introductory environment. Take this after several programming 
              classes. It covers front-end web development using HTML, CSS and
              javascript.
        
        9. GIS 321 - Programming for GIS
            - Another stats-heavy class (yay!). Offers an excellent
              introduction to GIT and uses the Python programming language,
              which is the best language for data-analysis. Keep in mind though,
              this class is only offered online, so be familiar with programming.
              (CSE 110 is a pre-req)
