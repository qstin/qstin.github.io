The Palm Beach Post, data reporting intern

    During my six months as a data intern with The Post's investigative
    team, I contributed analysis and graphics to long ans short-term
    projects. We are currently investigating hyper-aggressive campaign
    tactics that took advantage of blurred legal boundaries

The Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting, data reporting intern

    I wrote code that processed thousands of bills to trace model
    legislation to its source, used government and open-source APIs to 
    automate data-gathering and wrote about sparsely reported lobbyist
    expenditures.

The Arizona Republic, reporting intern
    
    I covered community, crime and cold cases as a reporting intern on the
    breaking news desk for more than a year.
